## üöÄ About Me

Hey there! I‚Äôm Subramaniam, or Subro to friends, navigating the intricate world of software engineering with a keen eye on AI and machine learning. My adventure in tech began with an insatiable curiosity about transforming data into smart decisions, leading me down a path filled with code, cloud, and countless learning moments.

I am an EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) PhD student in Electronic Engineering at Queen Mary University of London. My research focuses on RF emission detection, identification, and localisation, utilising Software-Defined Radio (SDR), advanced antennas, Cloud & IoT applications, AI/ML/DL applications, software engineering, and edge AI technologies. I have published my work in esteemed journals such as the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI), Cluster Computing (Springer), and arXiv. As an experienced software engineer, I specialize in SQL, Python frameworks like Django and Flask, and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I have implemented numerous automations in AWS, including Lambda, SQS, RDS, Fargate, EKS, and EC2. I am passionate about democratizing AI and leveraging machine learning to solve real-world challenges.

When I‚Äôm not coding or cloud-wrangling, I love demystifying AI and machine learning for anyone willing to listen. Whether through blog posts, discussions, or casual chats over coffee, I‚Äôm all about sharing knowledge and learning from others. After all, isn‚Äôt that how we all grow?

If you‚Äôre curious about AI, machine learning, or just want to exchange notes on the latest in tech, drop me a line at subramaniamsmurugesan@gmail.com. Let‚Äôs make AI not just a tool for the few, but a resource for the many. Who knows what we can achieve together?
